Description: toolbox for solving PDEs -- iterative solvers (development files)
 DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox
 for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.
 It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements (FE),
 Finite Volumes (FV), and also Finite Differences (FD).
 .
 This package contains the development files for the iterative solver template
 library.
