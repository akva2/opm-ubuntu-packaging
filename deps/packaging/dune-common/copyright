License: GPL-2 with DUNE exception
 The DUNE library and headers are licensed under version 2 of the GNU General
 Public License, with a special exception for linking and compiling against
 DUNE, the so-called "runtime exception." The license is intended to be
 similar to the GNU Lesser General Public License, which by itself isn't
 suitable for a template library.
 .
 The exact wording of the exception reads as follows:
 .
 As a special exception, you may use the DUNE library without
 restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or
 use macros or inline functions from one or more of the DUNE source
 files, or you compile one or more of the DUNE source files and link
 them with other files to produce an executable, this does not by
 itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
 General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate
 any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the
 GNU General Public License.
 .
 This license clones the one of the libstdc++ library.
 .
 On Debian systems, the full text of the GNU General Public License version 2
 can be found in the file  `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.
